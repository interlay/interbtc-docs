# Decentralized Governance

Interlay and Kintsugi each implement a token-based decentralized governance mechanism.
Governance token holders have the ultimate decision power over:

- **Runtime upgrades**: Fixes, substrate/library updates, improvements, new features, â€¦
- **Parameter upgrades**:
  - Stable BTC Confirmations
  - Whitelist collateral currencies and set thresholds
  - Parachain Status (On/Off)
  - Accepted oracles

- **Treasury management**: decision on how to spend the assets locks in the network treasury.
