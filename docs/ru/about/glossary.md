# Glossary

**Interlay** is a R&D company focusing on blockchain interoperability. Interlay envisions a future where blockchains seamlessly connect and interact. Interlay’s imminent mission is to make Bitcoin interoperable in a fully trustless and decentralized way. Founded by ex-Imperial College CS PhDs, our products are backed by top-tier scientific papers and collaborate with leading research labs and tech companies around the world.

**Kintsugi Labs** is a non-profit oriented organization responsible for the Kintsugi launch, whose mission is to support the development and growth of the decentralized network. 

**interBTC** is Interlay’s flagship product - Bitcoin on any blockchain. A 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset, fully collateralized, interoperable, and censorship-resistant. interBTC will be hosted as a Polkadot parachain and connected to Cosmos, Ethereum and other major DeFi networks. 

**INTR** is interBTC’s governance token, distributed across network participants and used to elect council members and vote on proposals. INTR will be used to govern the interBTC parachain on Polkadot. 

**Kintsugi** is Interlay’s canary network for interBTC, a testnet with real economic value deployed on Kusama (Polkadot’s canary network). Kintsugi and interBTC share the same code base - with the difference that Kintsugi will be 2-3 releases ahead of interBTC with more experimental features. 

**kBTC** is a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset on the Kintsugi canary network, deployed on Kusama. It follows the same design as interBTC, yet may feature more experimental functions and parameterizations.

**KINT** is Kintsugi’s governance token, the Kusama counterpart to INTR. 

**XCLAIM** is the protocol underlying interBTC and kBTC. XCLAIM was invented in 2018, and published as a top-tier, peer-reviewed scientific paper by Interlay founders. You can read the paper [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/643).
