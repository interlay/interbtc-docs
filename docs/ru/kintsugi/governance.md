# Decentralized Governance

Kintsugi adopts [Polkadot’s governance mechanism](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance), with two modifications: (1) optimistic governance and (2) stake-to-vote.

**Council**

Day-to-day decisions are made by an elected Council but can be overruled by the majority of KINT holders. The Council is democratically elected by KINT holders and anyone can run for office. A **Council rules for 7 days and users can change their vote after each such period**.

**Optimistic Governance**

To promote a more active governance process and avoid the “lazy voter” problem, Kintsugi implements “optimistic governance”: proposals agreed on by Council pass automatically, after an “objection period”, unless KINT holders actively vote to oppose. 

**Stake to Vote**

To vote, users lock KINT with the Kintsugi parachain. The locking period thereby will impact the voting power: the longer KINT are locked, the more voting power they have, since the voter has a long-term stake in the health of the system. 

**Technical Committee**

Kintsuigi also exhibits a Technical Committee (TC) of developer teams, voted on by the Council. The TC can make emergency proposals which, if accepted by the council, are “fast-tracked” and executed quickly, e.g. in case of critical software bugs.
