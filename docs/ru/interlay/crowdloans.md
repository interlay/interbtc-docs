# The Interlay Crowdloan

Interlay participates in the Polkadot parachain auctions and supports a crowdloan to enable the community to vote.
To participate in the crowdloan, you need to lock your DOT and vote for Interlay to become a parachain.

Below is a summary of the Interlay crowdloan details, as described in the [token economy whitepaper released by Kintsugi Labs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interlay/whitepapers/master/Interlay_Token_Economy.pdf).
