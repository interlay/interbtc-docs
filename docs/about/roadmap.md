# Roadmap

The Interlay team is building a customized Substrate environment for interBTC, optimized to verify Bitcoin payments. The BTC Parachain includes a Bitcoin cross-chain SPV client (BTC-Relay), integrations with secure price oracles and XCMP, as well as support for hardware wallets. In addition, Interlay is also building client software for Vaults, Relayers (who make sure BTC-Relay is up to date), as well as an easy-to-use web interface.

[Interlay](https://interlay.io/) has previously released a [detailed technical specification](https://interlay.gitlab.io/interbtc-spec/) and a [working PoC implementation](https://github.com/interlay/BTC-Parachain). After the successful pilot project, Interlay is now expediting efforts to complete the BTC Parachain in Q1 2021 - funded by a follow-up [Web3 Foundation grant](https://web3.foundation/grants/).

The Alpha was successfully launched in November 2020, a public feature-ready Beta launched on 2 March 2021.

Once the audit of the code base is completed and parachains are enabled on Polkadot and Kusama, the BTC Parachain will go live: first on Kusama, then on Polkadot mainnet.
