# Roadmap

The Interlay team is building a customized Substrate environment for interBTC, optimized to verify Bitcoin payments. The BTC Parachain includes a Bitcoin cross-chain SPV client (BTC-Relay), integrations with secure price oracles and XCMP, as well as support for hardware wallets. In addition, Interlay is also building client software for Vaults, Relayers (who make sure BTC-Relay is up to date), as well as an easy-to-use web interface.

[Interlay](https://interlay.io/) has previously released a [detailed technical specification](https://interlay.gitlab.io/interbtc-spec/) and a [working PoC implementation](https://github.com/interlay/interbtc). After the successful pilot project, Interlay won a second [Web3 Foundation grant](https://web3.foundation/grants/) to complete the BTC Parachain - the core milestones of this project were completed in March 2021.
