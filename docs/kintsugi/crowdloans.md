# The Kintsugi Crowdloan

Kintsugi participates in the Kusama parachain auctions and supports a crowdloan to enable the community to vote.
To participate in the crowdloan, you need to lock your KSM and vote for Kintsugi to become a parachain. 

Below is a summary of the Kintsugi crowdloan details, as described in the [token economy whitepaper released by Kintsugi Labs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interlay/whitepapers/master/Kintsugi_Token_Economy.pdf).
