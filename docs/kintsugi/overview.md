# Kintsugi - Interlay's Canary Network


### kBTC - Radically Open Bitcoin on Kusama

Kintsugi's kBTC brings radically open Bitcoin to Kusama to kickstart liquidity for parachains like Karura, Shiden and Moonriver.

**kBTC** is a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset on Kusama, maintained by a decentralized network of collateralized Vaults. Users must only ever trust that Bitcoin and the DeFi platform they use are secure.

Head over to the  [interBTC chapter](start/overview.md) of this documentation to read more about the underlying trustless and decentralized cross-chain technology (the [XCLAIM](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/643) protocol).

### KINT: Decentralized Governance

Kintsugi is ruled by its community from day one - via KINT, Kintsugi's governance token.

Read the [Tokenomics chapter](kintsugi/tokenomics.md) to learn about KINT's model, or read about the [Governance](kintsugi/governance.md) process.

### Parachain Auction and Crowdloans

Kintsugi is participating in the Kusama parachain auctions to win a parachain slot. To allow to community to vote for bringing BTC to Kusama, Kintsugi is running a crowdloan.

Read the [Crowdloan chapter](kintsugi/crowdloans.md) to learn more about the KINT distribution and the auction process and events.

**For the interested: read the [token economy primer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interlay/whitepapers/master/Kintsugi_Token_Economy.pdf) released by Kintsugi Labs for an in depth understanding of the Kintsugi tokenomics and governance models.**

### Kintsugi Origins

Inspired by the ancient [Japanese tradition of embracing the flawed and imperfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi), Kintsugi accepts the nascent DeFi ecosystem on Kusama as chaotic while constantly being perfected by golden streaks of its community.
