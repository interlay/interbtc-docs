# Incentivized Beta Testnet

The PolkaBTC Beta testnet is the final testing phase of the PolkaBTC bridge prior to launch on Kusama and Polkadot.

It is of utmost importance to achieve a high participation rate to:
- Detect left-over bugs,
- Receive feedback from users regarding the UI/UX,
- Test the Vault and Staked Relayer client software,
- Test integrations with other applications/parachains,
- Test expected failures (e.g. exchange rate fluctuations, oracle crashes, â€¦) and high operation under high system load.

## DOT Rewards

To achieve higher participation during Beta testnet, Interlay is organizing a number of events, competitions, and challenges to actively test critical components of the PolkaBTC bridge.

Polkadot Council has approved **1300 DOT** treasury funding for the PolkaBTC testnet campaign ([Link to approved proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/36)).
