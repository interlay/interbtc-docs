# Incentivized Beta Testnet

The PolkaBTC Beta testnet is the final testing phase of the PolkaBTC bridge prior to launch on Kusama and Polkadot.

It is of utmost importance to achieve a high participation rate to:
- Detect left-over bugs,
- Receive feedback from users regarding the UI/UX,
- Test the Vault and Staked Relayer client software,
- Test integrations with other applications/parachains,
- Test expected failures (e.g. exchange rate fluctuations, oracle crashes, â€¦) and high operation under high system load.

## DOT Rewards

To achieve higher participation during Beta testnet, Interlay is organizing a number of events, competitions, and challenges to actively test critical components of the PolkaBTC bridge.

Polkadot Council has approved **1300 DOT** treasury funding for the PolkaBTC testnet campaign ([see approved Polkassembly proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/36)).

## King of the Hill: Vaults and Relayers (200 DOT)

!> Important: You will need to submit your Polkadot address (starting with "1..") to participate in the king of the hill contest. Otherwise, we cannot match your address on the PolkaBTC bridge with your Polkadot address. If you already have submitted your DOT address via the form (https://forms.gle/V6LsUb3J9qR6oJCN8), you don't need to do it again.

We compute a lifetime SLA score for Vaults and Staked Relayers (each desirable action adds to the score, a failure to Redeem reduces the score significantly).
In the King of the Hill challenge, the top 10 Vaults and Relayers are rewarded with DOT at the end of each week for a period of 2 weeks (2 rounds). Scores are reset each week allowing new Vaults and Staked Relayers to join and have the chance to earn DOT rewards for participating.
