# Vaults

Vaults are the heart of the interBTC bridge. They are responsible for maintaining the physical 1:1 peg between BTC and interBTC.
Vaults receive BTC for safekeeping from users and ensure BTC remains locked while interBTC exists

Vaults are **non-trusted** and **collateralized** and **any user can become a Vault** by providing DOT collateral. This means: as a user, you can freely choose any Vault you like or be your own Vault. You donâ€™t have to trust anyone else if you want to be extra cautious.

The correct behavior of Vaults is enforced by the interBTC bridge parachain. Specifically, Vaults must prove correct behavior to the BTC-Relay component - a Bitcoin SPV client implemented directly on top of Polkadot. If a Vault tries to steal BTC, this will be automatically detected and the Vault will lose its collateral - and users will be reimbursed using this collateral (at a beneficial rate).

The secondary responsibility of a Vault is to monitor both Bitcoin and the interBTC bridge to ensure that the BTC-Relay (Bitcoin light/SPV client deployed on Polkadot) stays up to date with the Bitcoin mainchain by relaying Bitcoin block headers.

Note: BTC-Relay is self healing and automatically detects and recovers from Bitcoin forks.

### What do Vaults do?

1. **Provide DOT Collateral** and upload their Bitcoin public key to the interBTC bridge. The amount of collateral provided determines how much BTC the Vault can accept for safekeeping / how many interBTC this Vault can secure.
2. **Issue**: Vaults receive BTC from users for safekeeping. This locks the Vault's DOT collateral until BTC is redeemed again.
3. **Redeem**: Vaults monitor the interBTC bridge for redeem requests. When a user requests to redeem interBTC, Vaults release BTC to the user and prove that they behaved correctly to the interBTC bridge (via the BTC-Relay). Only if this proof is correct, the Vault's collateral is unlocked again.

To support the integrity of the parachain, Vaults are also able to assume the role of a Relayer:

1. **Maintain BTC-Relay**: submit Bitcoin block headers to interBTC's BTC-Relay and make sure the bridge stays up to date with the Bitcoin mainchain.
2. **Report Vault Theft**: monitor Vault Bitcoin addresses and BTC holdings and report theft to the interBTC bridge (providing an SPV proof to BTC-Relay)

### Why would I want to become a Vault?

1. **Yield farming:** Vaults earn fees in interBTC and receive a subsidy in DOT. As such, Vaults earn yield on their DOT collateral and have **exposure to both DOT and (Polka)BTC**.
2. **Self-custody:** Vaults hold BTC of users in custody. If you are a large liquidity provider, you can be your own vault and retain custody over your BTC holdings until you sell interBTC.

### What do I need to become a Vault?

1. Vault client ([source](https://github.com/interlay/interbtc-clients))
2. Bitcoin full node ([instructions](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node))
3. Polkadot account ([public/private keypair](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-keys))
4. Some DOTs to provide as collateral and pay for transaction fees

## Fee Model

Vaults earn fees on issue and redeem, based on the interBTC volume.

### Pool-based Fee Distribution

Vaults earn fees based on the issued and redeemed interBTC volume. To reduce variance of payouts, the interBTC bridge implements a **pooled fee model**.

Each time a user issues or redeems interBTC, they pay the following fees to a **global fee pool**:

- **Issue Fee**: `0.5%` of the Issue volume, paid in *interBTC*
- **Redeem**: `0.5%` of the redeem volume, paid in *interBTC*

From this fee pool, `100%` is distributed among all active Vaults based on the following factor:

- 100% based on the Vault's **BTC in custody** ( = issued interBTC) in proportion to the total locked BTC (= issued interBTC) across all Vaults

Specifically, each Vault's fee is calculated according to the following formula:

    vault_fee =
    pool * (vault_locked_btc / total_locked_btc)

The Vault fee is paid each time an Issue or Redeem request is executed.

## Collateral

To ensure Vaults have no incentive to steal user's BTC, Vaults provide collateral in DOT to the interBTC bridge.
To mitigate exchange rate fluctuations, the interBTC bridge employs *over-collateralization* and a *multi-level collateral balancing* scheme.

### Over-collateralization

Vaults must over-collateralize their BTC holdings by `150%` with DOT collateral.

This means, the amount of BTC a Vault can accept for safekeeping is calculated by:

    max_vault_btc = vault_dot_collateral / (1.5 * btc_dot_exchange_rate)

### Vault-Level Collateral Re-balancing

To protect against short and long term exchange rate fluctuations, Vaults are **instructed to keep their collateralization rate up to date**.
This can be achieved in 2 ways:

- **interBTC Redeem**: if users redeem with the Vault, the collateralization ratio increases. The Vault can also maintain a interBTC reserve and execute self-redeems for quick rebalancing
- **Increase Collateral**: alternatively, the Vault can also add more collateral to the system.

#### Thresholds and Balancing Mechanisms

The interBTC bridge introduces multiple thresholds with different actions to ensure Vaults never drop below 100% collateralization:

**Secure Collateral**:

- *Threshold*: `150%`
- *Actions*: None necessary. The Vault can freely redeem any "unused" collateral above the `150%` threshold.

**Premium Redeem**:

- *Threshold*: `135%`
- *Actions*: Users can execute redeem with this Vault and receive a premium of `5%` in DOT in addition to the redeemed BTC.

**Vault Liquidation**:

- *Threshold*: `110%`
- *Action*: The undercollateralized Vault is liquidated.
    1. The Vaults entire DOT collateral is slashed
    2. The interBTC bridge initiates a first-come-first-served liquidation swap: any user can **burn interBTC** in return for DOT collateral at a premium rate. See [**Burn Event**](/overview?id=burn-event-restoring-a-11-physical-peg) below.

## Slashing

If Vaults fail to behave according to protocol rules, they face punishment through slashing of collateral.
There are 2 types of failures: **safety failures** and **crash failures**.

If a Vault fails to execute a redeem on time, steals BTC or falls below the liquidation collateral threshold, a slashing event is initiated.

### Safety Failures

A safety failure occurs in two cases:

- **Theft**: a Vault is considered to have committed theft if it moves/spends BTC from unauthorized by the interBTC bridge. Theft is detected and reported by [Vaults](/vault/overview) via an SPV proof.

- **Severe Undercollteralization**: a Vaults drops below the `110%` liquidation collateral threshold.

In both cases, the **the Vault's entire BTC holdings are liquidated and its DOT collateral is slashed - up to `150%` (secure collateral threshold) of the liquidated BTC value**.

Consequently, the interBTC bridge initiates a [**Burn Event**](/overview?id=burn-event-restoring-a-11-physical-peg) to restore the 1:1 balance between BTC and interBTC.

### Crash Failures (Failed Redeem)

If Vaults go offline and fail to execute redeem, they are:

- **Penalized** (**punishment fee** slashed) and
- **Temporarily banned** for `24 hours` from accepting further redeem requests.

The **punishment fee** is calculated based on the Vault's SLA ([Service Level Agreement](/vault/overview?id=service-level-agreements)) level, which is a value between `0` and `100`.
The higher the Vault's SLA, the lower the punishment for a failed redeem.

In detail, the punishment fee is calculated as follows:

- **Minimum Punishment Fee**: `10%` of the failed redeem value.
- **Maximum Punishment Fee**: `30%` of the failed redeem value.
- **Punishment Fee**: calculated based on the Vaults SLA value as follows. Note: the maximum SLA (`max_sla`) value is `100` (see [here](/vault/overview?id=service-level-agreements)).


    punishment_fee =
        min_punishment_fee +
        ((max_punishment_fee - min_punishment_fee) / max_sla * vault_sla)


**Note**: the SLA of a Vault is **reset to 0 after a single failed redeem request** and the Vault must behave correctly / be online for prolonged periods to build up a high SLA level again.

## Burn Event: Restoring a 1:1 Physical Peg

When a Vault is liquidated, its DOT collateral is slashed up to`150%` of the liquidated BTC value, given the exchange rate at the time of liquidation.

The interBTC bridge now has less BTC locked than interBTC minted - but more than enough DOT collateral to maintain economic security.
To re-establish the physical 1:1 peg between BTC and interBTC, the interBTC bridge allows users to **burn interBTC in return for DOT at a premium rate**.

Specifically, the user's payout is calculated as follows:


    burn_dot_payout =
        (total_liquidated_dot_collateral / total_liquidated_interbtc)
        * user_burned_interbtc

As long as the economic value of `burn_dot_payout` is higher than that of `user_burned_interbtc`, which may include private information of the user (that is, the user may think that DOT will become worth more soon), users are incentivized to burn interBTC in return for DOT and to re-balance the system.

This Burn Event continues until the 1:1 ratio of BTC to interBTC is restored.
