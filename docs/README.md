# What is the Interlay Network?


### Interlay is a modular, programmable layer between Bitcoin and the multi-chain ecosystem that unlocks decentralized (financial) use cases for BTC.

Interlayâ€™s vision is to help Bitcoin achieve mass adoption by unlocking decentralized (financial) use cases for BTC and removing the need for centralized services. Interlay's achieves this by creating the necessary infrastructure and financial tooling for both users and builders:

**DeFi for Bitcoin**: Interlay's DeFi hub a one-stop shop for all things decentralized Bitcoin finance featuring BTC swaps, lending, and staking. High throughput, low fees payable in any asset, and native stablecoin integrations aim to provide an experience competing even with centralized providers.

**Bitcoin for DeFi**: Interlay's BTC bridge is the secure way to use Bitcoin in the multi-chain ecosystem. iBTC, a 1:1 BTC-backed asset, is secured by a decentralized network of vaults. BTC deposits are insured by a multi-collateral system and secured by cross-chain light clients.
